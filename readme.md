## These are dotfiles

### Install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mattfelten/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
. ~/.dotfiles/setup
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.

### Credits
I've blatently stolen code from many places.
